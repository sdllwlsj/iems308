       "  \"Reason: Today's low interest rates make reverse mortgages something of a bargain, allowing you to borrow more if you lock in before rates rise.A reverse mortgage is a loan against the homeowner's equity, which is the current value of the home minus any debt against it, such as a mortgage or home equity loan.\",\n",
       "  'Like an ordinary mortgage, the reverse loan charges interest, but the borrower makes no monthly payments.',\n",
       "  'Instead, the debt, plus the gradually growing interest charges, are paid off when the borrower moves permanently, sells the home or dies.',\n",
       "  \"The debt can never exceed the proceeds of the home sale, so the reverse mortgage debt does not endanger the borrower's other assets.\",\n",
       "  'The most common type of reverse mortgage is the federally backed Home Equity Conversion Mortgage.',\n",
       "  \"Because there's no telling how large the borrower's debt could grow, reverse loans manage the lender's risk by providing less than 100% of the homeowner's equity at the time the loan is approved.\",\n",
       "  'A key factor in this calculation is the \"expected interest rate.\"',\n",
       "  'The lower it is, the more the homeowner can borrow, and rates are quite low today.',\n",
       "  '\"For example, at an expected rate of 4 percent, which has been a common rate during 2013, a senior of 62 with a home worth $300,000 can draw an initial credit line of about $174,000,\" Guttentag says.',\n",
       "  '\"At an expected rate of 6 percent, the line drops to $140,000, and at 10 percent it falls to $54,000.\"',\n",

       "  \"If you take out a line of credit to draw on in the future, or select a regular monthly payment, the accrual rate is adjustable -- it will rise or fall as market conditions change.A rising rate need not be a concern if you expect to keep the reverse mortgage for the rest of your life, because you don't have to make payments no matter how high the rate goes.\",\n",
       "  '(Of course, a higher rate would drive up your interest costs, cutting deeper into any home equity you might hope to leave your heirs.)',\n",
